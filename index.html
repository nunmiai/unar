                            <h3>The Name: Unar (உணர்)</h3>
                            <p>
                                We chose the name <strong>Unar</strong> because it translates to more than just "sense." 
                                It means to feel, to realize, and to become aware. Our brand is built on the belief that 
                                every action should be a mindful ritual—a moment where you pause to connect with yourself 
                                like our first product "Natural Solid Perfumes".
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>The Story of Unar: From Our Home to Your Skin</h3>
                            <p>
                                We began searching for a natural fragrance because we were tired of harsh chemicals and 
                                full of guilt when the same was used by our child. Available options were limited to the 
                                fragrance of west and usage of synthetics for mass production. We missed the honest scents 
                                of our daily lives—the Champa, Frangipani, and Vetiver we walk past every day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, we started researching. What began as a quest for the "right mix" became a beautiful 
                                family ritual. Much like baking or fishing, crafting these perfumes brought our family 
                                members closer. We discovered that a natural scent is a powerful mood elevator that 
                                shouldn't require synthetic alcohol or artificial flavors.
                            </p>
                            <p class="highlight">
                                We created Unar (உணர்) to share this realization. Our goal is to help you become mindful 
                                of what touches your skin. Even if you only try a sample, we hope it changes how you choose 
                                your fragrance forever.
                            </p>
                            <p class="tagline">
                                <strong>From our family to yours—experience Conscious Living.</strong>
                            </p>

                            <h3>The Realization</h3>
                            <p>
                                For years, the fragrance industry has focused on "projection"—creating a cloud of scent 
                                designed to be noticed by everyone else in the room. But we asked a different question: 
                                What if fragrance wasn't for the room? What if it was for you?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We noticed that traditional perfumes, filled with harsh alcohols and synthetic chemicals, 
                                often felt like a mask rather than an essence. We wanted something deeper—a fragrance that 
                                didn't just sit on the skin but became a part of it. We found limited options but with 
                                cheap synthetics and limited western blends.
                            </p>

                            <h3>The Craft</h3>
                            <p>
                                We stripped away the alcohol and the aerosols, returning to the ancient, tactile tradition 
                                of solid perfumes. Our formula is a deliberate blend of nature's most resilient ingredients:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Pure Beeswax: The Protective Architect</strong><br>
                                As the structural foundation, beeswax provides a natural "hold" while acting as a fixative 
                                that anchors fragrance to the skin. It creates a breathable barrier that prevents scent 
                                evaporation, ensuring an intimate, long-lasting aroma that stays close to your pulse points.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jojoba Oil: The Seamless Carrier</strong><br>
                                Mirroring the skin's natural oils, this liquid wax acts as a weightless bridge for deep, 
                                instant absorption. It delivers the fragrance effectively without any greasy residue, 
                                leaving a clean and silky finish that feels like a natural extension of your skin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Shea Butter: The Velvety Emollient</strong><br>
                                Shea butter provides a decadent, creamy texture that melts at body temperature for a smooth, 
                                effortless application. It deeply conditions the skin, transforming the perfume from a solid 
                                to a soft, moisturizing veil that feels rich and luxurious to the touch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The Essence of Nature: The Living Soul</strong><br>
                                These authentic botanical extracts interact with your unique body chemistry to create a 
                                personalized, evolving scent profile. Unlike synthetics, these "living" essences offer a 
                                multi-dimensional aromatic journey that is as honest and gentle as the flowers themselves.
                            </p>

                            <h3>The Ritual</h3>
                            <p>
                                Unar is designed for the intimate areas of your life—your pulse points, your neck, and even 
                                for natural odor control in your underarms. It is travel-friendly, spill-proof, and designed 
                                to evolve with your body chemistry over the course of the day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are clear from day one that we are not selling but offering a journey of realization where 
                                anyone can be part of and be mindful, conscious and guiltfree.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Solid perfume is a concentrated fragrance made from natural waxes and oils. 
                                Unlike alcohol-based perfumes, our solid perfumes are gentle on the skin, 
                                long-lasting, and perfect for on-the-go application.

                                    Use the spatula to take a small amount. Glide it directly onto your pulse points 
                                    (wrists, neck, behind ears) and underarms until absorbed.
