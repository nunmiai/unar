Unar: Fragrance, Realized.
The journey of Unar (உணர்) began when a simpler, more honest path was sought. For too long, the world has relied on harsh chemicals that mask our true nature. A deep longing was felt for the familiar scents of our daily lives—the Champa, the Frangipani, and the Vetiver that we walk past every day but rarely truly notice.
What started as a search for the "perfect mix" soon became a cherished family ritual. In the quiet blending of natural oils, a spouse and a child were brought closer together. Much like the shared joy of baking or the patience of fishing, these perfumes were crafted with love and a clear purpose. It was discovered that nature provides everything needed to elevate the mood, without the need for synthetic spirits or artificial flavors.
Unar exists so this discovery can be shared with you. The mission is not merely to sell a product, but to inspire a more conscious choice for what touches the skin. It is hoped that this experience helps you return to a more natural way of living.
Feel Yourself. From our family’s heart to yours—this is fragrance, realized.
